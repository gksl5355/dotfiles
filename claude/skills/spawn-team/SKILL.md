---

## Roles

**Leader** = this skill running as the main Claude session. Not a spawned agent. Leader orchestrates the entire workflow: proposes teams, spawns agents, assigns tasks, reviews results, merges.

---

## Step 0: Intent Scan

Auto-scan (no questions unless needed): package.json/requirements.txt/go.mod → stack, src/app/lib → scale, .git → worktree availability.

Ask only if: non-standard structure can't be auto-detected, or request is ambiguous.

---

## Step 1: Project Analysis

Run 1-1 and 1-2 concurrently.

### 1-1. Tech Stack
Detect from package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.

### 1-2. Domain Detection + Structure Type

| Type | Condition | Ownership Model |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| [A] Domain directories (default) | src/auth/**, src/products/** | Directory-level ownership |
| [B] Flat structure (fallback) | src/services/auth.ts, file-per-function | File-level MECE manifest |
| [C] Unclear/Legacy | Domain boundaries unidentifiable | architect-agent first → convert to [A] |

Detection failure → AskUserQuestion for manual spec, or assign 1 fullstack agent.

### 1-3. Domain Scale → Ownership Manifest

- small (1-3 files): merge candidate
- medium (4-9): 1 independent agent
- large (10+): 1 agent (suggest split)

Each file/directory belongs to exactly 1 entry. Shared files → Leader owns.

---

## Step 2: Complexity Scoring

| Criterion | 1 pt | 2 pts | 3 pts |
|-----------|------|-------|-------|
| Domain count | 1 | 2-3 | 4+ |
| File scale | ≤10 | 11-50 | 51+ |
| Dependencies | Independent | Low | High (mutual) |
| Structure | [A] | [B] | [C] |

```
4-6  → SIMPLE:  skip to Step 5 (no scope/plan questions)
7-9  → MEDIUM:  Step 3 → Step 5
10+  → COMPLEX: Step 3 → Step 4 → Step 5
Auto COMPLEX: explicit plan request, structure [C]
Score=LOW clarity → AskUserQuestion ×1, re-score, continue.
```

---

## Step 3: Scope Confirmation (MEDIUM/COMPLEX only)

AskUserQuestion ×1:
- **IN**: detected domains + files + shared
- **OUT**: external systems (mock only), CI/CD, performance tuning
- **DEFER**: low-priority domains

After confirmation → scope locked. Change attempts → warning + re-confirmation.

---

## Step 4: Planning (COMPLEX only)

### 4-1. Structured Interview (AskUserQuestion, 3-5 questions)
Q1 core objective / Q2 success criteria ×3 (measurable) / Q3 constraints / Q4 risks / Q5 ordering preference

### 4-2. Wave Decomposition

3–5 waves as needed:
```
Wave 1 (parallel): Foundation — types, schemas, shared interfaces
Wave 2 (parallel): Core — domain logic per agent
Wave 3 (sequential): Integration — cross-domain, shared files
Wave N (parallel): Verification — tests
Wave Final: merge (+ Codex review if requested)
```

**Task format (per task):**
```
Task: {verb} {target} → {expected output}
Accepts: {concrete testable criterion}
BlockedBy: {task-id | none}
```
Rules: ≤10 tasks per agent. Accepts missing → task not issued. Scope ≤200 LOC or 1 module.

### 4-3. Validation

4-criteria check (all must pass):
1. **Clarity** — every task has a concrete Accepts criterion
2. **Verifiability** — Accepts is testable/measurable
3. **Context sufficiency** — agent can execute without asking for missing info
4. **Wave coherence** — Wave order matches dependency direction, no circular deps

**Gap+Risk Review (self-check):** "3 requirements likely missed? 3 ways this plan could fail?" → resolve gaps, surface top risk to user.

---

## Step 5: Team Composition Proposal

**Hard cap: 5 agents. Fully flexible — adapt to the actual task.**

### Model Selection

| Model | Use for |
|-------|---------|
| **Sonnet** | Planning, complex coding, multi-file coordination, architecture decisions |
| **Haiku** | Simple test execution, linting, format checks, repetitive verification, sub-agents |
| **Codex (CLI)** | Purely mechanical, zero-context code generation (see Codex Offloading below) |
| **Codex xhigh** | Debate + pre-merge final review only (read-only) |

**No Opus under any circumstances.**

### Team Composition (starting point — adapt freely)

| Task type | Typical composition |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Feature dev, small | fullstack(sonnet) + unit-tester(haiku) |
| Feature dev, medium | domain-be(sonnet) + domain-fe(sonnet) + unit-tester(haiku) |
| Feature dev, large | planner(sonnet) + domain-a(sonnet) + domain-b(sonnet) + tester(haiku) ×2 |
| Test-heavy | tester-unit(haiku) + tester-integration(haiku) + tester-e2e(sonnet) |
| Review/audit | security-reviewer(sonnet) + perf-reviewer(sonnet) + quality(haiku) |
| Migration/refactor | architect(sonnet) + coder-a(sonnet) + coder-b(sonnet) |

Mix freely. Only constraints: 5-agent cap, MECE scope ownership.

### Codex Offloading (use sparingly)

Delegate to Codex only when ALL hold: (1) zero codebase context required, (2) purely mechanical output, (3) result verifiable at a glance.

Good: standalone utility function with fixed signature, standard config file (.eslintrc, .gitignore), empty test file skeleton.
Bad: CRUD touching existing models, type defs referencing existing types, anything reading existing files first.

Claude writes directly for everything else. Codex failure → write directly, no retry.

### Worktree

- 3+ agents → `isolation: "worktree"` (requires git). Apply uniformly, never partial.
- ≤2 agents → shared (omit isolation).
- Git unavailable → fallback to shared, cap ≤2 agents, notify user.

---

## Step 6: User Confirmation

**SIMPLE**: AskUserQuestion ×1 — team composition only. On confirm → spawn + auto-start original request.

**MEDIUM/COMPLEX**: AskUserQuestion ×1 — team composition (COMPLEX: include Wave plan + top risk from Gap+Risk Review). On confirm → spawn.

---

## Step 7: Spawn Team

### 7-1. TeamCreate + Spawn Agents

```
TeamCreate: team_name, description
Per agent (Agent tool): subagent_type: "general-purpose", team_name, name: "{domain}-{role}", run_in_background: true
```

**Model selection — write signal file via Bash BEFORE each Agent spawn:**
```bash
# Sonnet (complex coding, planning, multi-file)
echo "claude-sonnet-4-6" > /tmp/claude-team-model

# Haiku (simple tests, linting, repetitive checks)
echo "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001" > /tmp/claude-team-model
```
Signal file is consumed after one spawn. Default (no file) = Sonnet.
Requires: tmux session + model wrapper installed via `install.sh`. Without tmux, agents run in-process and bypass the wrapper — all agents default to Opus.

Partial spawn failure → TeamDelete rollback → notify → suggest retry.

### 7-2. Agent Prompts

Read `.claude/skills/spawn-team/prompts.md` → inject Common Header + role-specific prompt for each agent. Append Wave info (COMPLEX only).

---

## Step 8: Execution & Feedback Loop

### 8-1. Task Distribution

COMPLEX: Task format (Task/Accepts/BlockedBy). MEDIUM: brief Accepts in description. SIMPLE: plain description.
Independent tasks → parallel. Dependent → blockedBy.
COMPLEX: Wave order enforced — Leader sends "WAVE {N} COMPLETE" to gate next Wave.

### 8-2. Progress Updates (mandatory)

Report to user at: each agent completion ("{agent} done — {n}/{total}"), Wave transitions, FAIL escalations.

Mid-run summary file `/tmp/summary-{wave|final}.md` (cap 1500 chars): decisions / open issues / PASS·FAIL counts / next objective.
- COMPLEX: write after each Wave.
- MEDIUM: write once after all agents complete.
- SIMPLE: skip.

### 8-3. Implementation → Test Loop

```
Agent done → tester verifies
  PASS → next phase
  FAIL → report to Leader + agent → fix → re-verify
    2x FAIL → agent self-spawns debugger sub-agent (Haiku, depth-1, read-only) → relay findings → fix
    post-debugger FAIL → AskUserQuestion: "1) Leader intervenes 2) Skip 3) Abort"
```

Build failure: agent self-spawns build-fixer sub-agent (Haiku, depth-1, scoped). Failure → Leader escalation.

Structure [C] — architect-agent (Sonnet, once before coding): analyze legacy → design directory structure → Leader review → user approval → refactor → convert to [A]. Failure → fallback [B].

### 8-4. Merge Protocol

```
Pre-merge: git diff --numstat main → 100+ LOC changed → inspect hunks
Scope check: git diff --name-only main | grep -vE "{owned-pattern}" → out-of-scope → revert
Order: 1. shared (Leader) → 2. independent domains → 3. high-dependency → 4. tests
Post-merge: build check → FAIL → build-fixer
Conflicts: same file → AskUserQuestion / different files → Leader auto-resolves
```

Shared type/schema change: non-breaking → approve / breaking → consider Debate → pause affected agents → Leader edits → notify → unit-tester re-run.

### 8-5. Completion

1. scenario-tester → FAIL → fix → re-verify
2. Worktree merge (per 8-4)
3. AskUserQuestion: "Run Codex xhigh review before finalizing?" → yes: run ×1 (read-only). Failure → skip.
4. Completion report

**Shutdown conditions (AND):** all tasks completed + unit-tester PASS + scenario-tester PASS + (COMPLEX) all Wave criteria satisfied → shutdown_request to all → TeamDelete.

## Debate Mode

Adversarial architecture review via Codex xhigh. Details: `.claude/skills/debate/SKILL.md`.

Hard trigger: irreversible=true or impact=3. Soft: risk score 6+.
6-7 → Leader Judge. 8-9 or hard → User Judge.

---

## Operating Rules

- **Leader reads**: DONE items → `git diff --numstat` check only. High-risk (public API / auth / payment / 100+ LOC / post-FAIL fix) → inspect hunks directly.
- **Idle**: quota consumed only on message. Keep agents alive until done.
- **Quota**: 1 agent ≈ 7×. Hard cap: 5 agents. Sub-agents do NOT count toward cap.
- **Sub-agents**: depth-1 only (no nesting). ≤2 per agent. Haiku only. debugger=read-only, build-fixer=scoped edits.
- **File isolation**: own domain only. Shared → Leader. 1 agent per file (MECE). Violation → revert.
- **Testers**: report only, no edits. Peer comms: technical → direct, decisions → Leader.
- **Tokens**: `wc -l` before Read → 500+ lines use offset+limit. Explore→Grep→Read (needed parts only). No repeat reads. Extract essentials from tool output. Leader embeds shared context (types, interfaces) into spawn prompts to avoid cross-agent duplicate exploration.
- **Worktree**: sequential merge only. No parallel merges. No direct work on main.
- **Planning**: SIMPLE = none, MEDIUM = scope only (Step 3), COMPLEX = interview + Wave. Scope locked after Step 3.
